# Introduction 

After being forced to used a Mac Book Pro for work, I can see why people love it so much, to be productive while programming. The terminal experience is superb. Everything runs super fast. No GUI is in your way. 

Windows always lacked behind in the console experience as it did not have a Linux type terminal available. This changed in the last years. Some of the notable changes, that led me to write this post, are: 

- The **Linux Subsystem for Windows** a.k.a. WSL was introduced. 
- Microsoft brought **PowerToys** back 
- There is a new Windows Terminal available 
- The PowerShell got a package manager with chocolatry 
- Linux tools can be directly called from Windows
